  <h3>The journey about Online-notes</h3>
  <p>The idea of this Online-notes is from the daily learning.</p>
  <p>Learning is fun, but it's impossible to memorize all the detail.</p>
  <p>The main purpose of Online-notes isn't an alternative for the existed online web-note,
    like HackMD、Notion、Medium.</p>
  <p>Via doing this project, I've learned PHP、MYSQL and the method transmit from different page.</p>
  <p>Although Online-notes is very crude and some function isn't even finish
    (etc. the carousel from welcome.php). </p>
  <p>In the future, I'll finish the remained function(etc. the decoration of Online-notes and the carousel).</p>
  <p>If you have any improvement about this project or any idea, you can contact me by karta25768@gmail.com.</p>
